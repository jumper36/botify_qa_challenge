# botify_qa_challenge
This is my QA challenge for Botify

The goal of this project is to create a test script that controls a Browser to go to a Google search page,
perform a search, and analyze the results.

The test consists of 2 steps:

- Implement a Test script that automates a Google search

- Implement a few key Test cases



Step 2: Test Cases

In a separate branch , implement the following test cases :

- Case 1: For a search with “site:” in the query, make sure all results returned on page 1 are on the
right host.

- Case 2: For a search with “filetype:” in the query, make sure all results returned on page 1 have
the right file extension.

- Case 3: For a search with “inurl:” in the query, make sure all results returned on page 1 have the
query in their url.

- Case 4: A random mathematical calculus using the “+” operator responds correctly.

- Case 5: A random mathematical calculus using the “-” operator responds correctly.

- Case 6: A random mathematical calculus using the “/” operator responds correctly.

- Case 7: A random mathematical calculus using the “*” operator responds correctly.

- Case 8: A random mathematical calculus using the “% of” operator responds correctly (not the
modulo operator, the percentage operator, activated via “% of”).
