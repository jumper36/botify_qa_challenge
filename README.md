# botify_qa_challenge
This is my QA challenge for Botify

Step 1: Browser Automation 

Create a script, using the language, driver, and testing framework of your choice that executes a 
Google search for a given query and checks that the resulting page has 10 results.

The tools/librairies that helped us performing this challenge is :

● Language: Python3

● Driver: chromedriver_win32

● Browser: Google Chrome

● Test framework: Pytest


Note : for this step (#1), we will be opening a new instance of Google Chrome every time the script is executed.
